Coordinate  | Transformation Object | Description
data        | ax.transData          | The userland data coordinate system, controlled by the xlim and ylim
axes        | ax.transAxes          | The coordinate system of the Axes; (0,0) is bottom left of the axes, and
            |                       | (1,1) is top right of the axes.
figure      | fig.transFigure       | The coordinate system of the Figure; (0,0) is bottom left of the
            |                       | figure, and (1,1) is top right of the figure.
display     | None                  | This is the pixel coordinate system of the display; (0,0) is the bottom
            |                       | left of the display, and (width, height) is the top right of the display
            |                       | in pixels. Alternatively, the identity transform
            |                       | (matplotlib.transforms.IdentityTransform()) may be used instead of None.

The important thing to remember is that the transforms all convert from the source coordinate system to display coordinates
